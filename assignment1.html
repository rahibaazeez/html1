    <h3>Front end</h3>
    <p>Frontend programming involves creating the user interface and interaction components of a software application or website that users directly interact with. It's responsible for presenting the visual elements, layout, and design of the application. Frontend programming includes writing code that runs in a web browser, typically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        Here's a breakdown of the key components in frontend programming:
        
        1. *HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):* HTML is used to structure the content and layout of web pages. It defines the various elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
        
        2. *CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):* CSS is used to style the appearance of the HTML elements. It controls aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and overall visual design.</p>
       <h3>Back end</h3> 
       <p>Backend programming refers to the development of the server-side components of a software application or website. It involves writing code that runs on the server and handles tasks like processing data, managing databases, and handling user requests. Backend programming languages commonly used include Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and PHP. Developers working on the backend create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the frontend and other services to communicate with the server. They also manage data storage, authentication, security, and overall server-side logic to ensure the application functions properly.</p>
